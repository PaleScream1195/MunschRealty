# MunschRealty
Website code for Munsch Realty Business 

We are going to be working with Munsch Real Estate and Auction, LLC. to create a website for them. They are looking for a product that will allow them to showcase their home sales. They would like to have a mortgage calculator tool, a preapproval tab that will link to their supported Mortgage Firm, CS Mortgage, LLC., an integration of IDX technology for home listings, a calculator to estimate value of current home, a page to showcase the links to YouTube videos that will be showing video tours of the homes they have, a link that will take you back to their other site, Munsch Auctions, and a page that will showcase the open houses that they currently have. They would also like to have a page that will show property listings, a page for buyers and sellers to talk about why to buy/sell with them, a page that will provide info for first time home buyers and the different loan types that there are, community page that will showcase IDX listings of nearby homes, an About Us page, and a contact us form. They would also like us to implement a collection of testimonials that have been collected from past customers and a feedback form that will allow people to talk about what they liked and did not like.
