      <h2>Levi Wilkens – Realtor</h2><br>
      I’m Levi Wilkens, I was born and raised in Atwood, Kansas by my mother Carol Wilkens.
      <br>
      I attended Rawlins County Jr./Sr. High School and graduated in 2007.
      <br>
      In the years growing up in small town America, I learned much of what I hold most dear today from
      my grandfather, Jim “Chopper” Wilkens.  He taught me what it was to be a man.
      To be honest, work hard, and love.  Be honest in all you do, especially your business dealings, for it
      will all come back to you.  Work hard to provide for your family, and most importantly love them with all your heart.
      <br>
      I have known Bob Munsch for several years and have seen much of the same actions in him as I did in my grandpa.
      That is why, when I decided to make a career move into real estate I knew right away that I
      belonged here at Munsch Real Estate & Auction.  Together with Bob, I hope to give Kansas and all it’s wonderful
      residents only the best when buying or selling their home or business.
